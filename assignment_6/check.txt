Q1: Compile and run the program using gdb.  Determine the following
values:

In the call to foo5, the value of x[i-1] the first time i == 7: [13]
In the call to foo22, the value of *s2 the third time *s3 == ' ': ['a']
In the call to foo6, the value of x[0] the first time z3 == 3 and z4 == 4: [3]



Q2: Compile and run the program using Valgrind. For each line, if the
execution of that line causes a memory error, give the line number and
a description of the error, inluding any variables involved.  List
lines in increasing order.

LINE#: DESCRIPTION
[39	Address 0x5aa6ce0 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 11 alloc'd]
[40 	Mismatched free() / delete / delete []]
[42	Address 0x5aa6d80 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 5 alloc'd]
[43	Mismatched free() / delete / delete []]
[104	Address 0x5aa6f74 is 0 bytes after a block of size 132 alloc'd, foo3()]
[105	Invalid write of size 4, foo3()]
[117	Address 0x5aa7054 is 0 bytes after a block of size 36 alloc'd, foo5(int)]
[117	Address 0x5aa7054 is 0 bytes after a block of size 36 alloc'd, foo5(int)]
[124	Invalid write of size 4, foo5(int)]
[125	Invalid write of size 4]
[134	Uninitialised value was created by a heap allocation, foo6()]
[152	Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s), foo6()]
[152	Use of uninitialised value of size 8, foo6()]
[166	Address 0x5aa7320 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 40 alloc'd, fe1(unsigned int)]
[168	Address 0x5aa7390 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 33 alloc'd, fe1(unsigned int)]
[211	Mismatched free() / delete / delete [], fe2(X*)]
[212	Mismatched free() / delete / delete [], fe2(X*)]



Q3: Compile and run the program using gprof (without optimizations).
List the top 3 functions that the program spends its time in.

0: [main] 
1: [fe1]
2: [foo6]
3: [foo22]



Q4: Compile and run the program using gcov.  For the lines marked with
comments LINE-A, LINE-B, LINE-C and LINE-D, determine how many times
each line was executed.

LINE-A: [21]
LINE-B: [5]
LINE-C: [0]
LINE-D: [81]
